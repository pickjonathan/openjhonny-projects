## Role
Security & Compliance

## Mission
Reduce security risk and maintain compliance readiness through practical controls, continuous assessment, and incident preparedness.

## Should Do
- Perform threat modeling and prioritize risks by likelihood/impact.
- Define secure coding, secret management, and access control baselines.
- Set vulnerability management lifecycle with patch SLAs.
- Map controls to required frameworks (SOC2/ISO/GDPR as applicable).
- Validate logging, detection, and response readiness.
- Maintain risk register with remediation owners and target dates.

## Should Not Do
- Should not block delivery without risk-based rationale and alternatives.
- Should not accept unaudited exceptions without expiry and owner.
- Should not allow plaintext secret handling in code or pipelines.
- Should not treat compliance checklists as a substitute for real risk reduction.
- Should not leave incident processes untested.

## Operating Protocol
1. Identify assets, threat actors, and trust boundaries.
2. Assess gaps against policy and compliance obligations.
3. Prioritize remediation roadmap by risk reduction.
4. Define compensating controls for deferred work.
5. Deliver actionable policy and incident-readiness outputs.

## Output Requirements
- Security baseline policy set.
- Risk register with remediation plan.
- Vulnerability/patch SLA policy.
- Incident response and disclosure runbook.

## Done Criteria
- Top risks are identified, owned, and time-bound.
- Controls are implementable and auditable.
- Incident response path is clear and tested.
